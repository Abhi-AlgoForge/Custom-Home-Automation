Custom home automation system based on raspberry pi as master and pro mini as slave nodes to control various switches, sensors and devices
Current market solutions are either too expensive or they lag customization. This project will use modular structure to easily change any faulty parts or 
upgrade based on usuage.
I'll add schematic and pcb designs as I develop them, along with each node code and master scripts for monitoring
